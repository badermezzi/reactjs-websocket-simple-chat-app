# Plan: Playing Audio Based on State Change (Blob URL Method)

This guide outlines the steps to play an audio file in React when a specific state variable changes, using the Fetch/Blob URL method to avoid potential issues with direct file paths and download managers.

1.  **Place Logic:**
    *   Implement the following steps within a React component that remains mounted whenever the audio might need to play based on the state change.

2.  **Add `<audio>` Tag:**
    *   Include an `<audio>` element in the component's JSX.
    *   Use a `ref` to access the element.
    *   Bind the `src` attribute to a state variable that will hold the Blob URL. Initialize `src` to an empty string or `null`.
    *   Example: `<audio ref={audioRef} src={blobUrl || ''} loop preload="auto" />`

3.  **Create Refs and State:**
    *   Create a ref for the audio element: `const audioRef = useRef(null);`
    *   Create state to hold the Blob URL: `const [blobUrl, setBlobUrl] = useState(null);`

4.  **Fetch Audio & Create Blob URL:**
    *   Use a `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array (`[]`) to run once on mount.
    *   Inside the effect:
        *   Use `fetch('/path/to/your/sound.mp3')` to get the audio file.
        *   Handle the response: check if `response.ok`, then get `response.blob()`.
        *   Create the Blob URL: `const objectUrl = URL.createObjectURL(blob);`
        *   Store the URL in state: `setBlobUrl(objectUrl);`
        *   Handle potential errors during fetch or blob creation.
    *   Return a cleanup function from this `useEffect`:
        *   Inside the cleanup, check if the `objectUrl` was created.
        *   If yes, revoke it: `URL.revokeObjectURL(objectUrl);`
        *   Optionally, clear the state: `setBlobUrl(null);`

5.  **Control Playback Based on State:**
    *   Use a separate `useEffect` hook that includes the state variable you want to monitor (`triggerState`) in its dependency array (e.g., `[triggerState]`).
    *   Inside this effect:
        *   Check if the `triggerState` meets the condition to play the sound (e.g., `if (triggerState === 'someValue')`).
        *   If the condition is met, play the audio: `audioRef.current?.play().catch(e => console.error("Audio play failed:", e));` (Handle potential errors, especially the user interaction requirement).
        *   If the condition is *not* met (or in an `else` block), pause and reset the audio:
            ```javascript
            if (audioRef.current && !audioRef.current.paused) {
                audioRef.current.pause();
                audioRef.current.currentTime = 0;
            }
            ```
    *   Consider adding a cleanup function to this effect as well, to pause/reset the audio if the component unmounts *while* the trigger condition is met (though the main Blob URL cleanup handles the resource leak).
